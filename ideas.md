Important events in the 13. century: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_century

It is important to note that the following events did not happen (or were not significant) during the 13. century:
* black death
* burning of "witches"

## (!) Church in a Mafia Simulation
* Increase the number of followers
* kill everyone who stands in your way
* special events "inquisition"
* point and click game

## Battles of the time
* Could be any battle, see wiki list
* tower defense or a mini strategy game

## Medieval Bitlife
* Similar to the original [Bitlife](https://bitlifeonline.com/) but in Medieval times
* Would be a highly frustrating game but an interesting learning experience

## (!) Catharian
* You play a catharian
* The catholic church wants to kill you
* Your goal is to evade the catholic christians as long as possible
* improve your belief and gain "holy power"
* might be a funny rogue like (or lite)

## Golden Bull
* Wikipedia definition: A golden bull was a decree issued by Byzantine Emperors and monarchs in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
* There are multiple golden bulls, we could use the "Diploma Andreanum"
  * issued by King Andrew II of Hungary in 1224
  * granting provisional autonomy to colonial Germans residing in the region of Transylvania
* we could create a literal golden bull
* instead of being forced to issue the golden bull, Andrew II of Hungary releases a golden bull (animal)
* the bull must be caught by the player, only then the colonial Germans are granted provisional autonomy
* (other golden bulls work as well)
* the game can be a jump&run

## (!) Bitlife + (Church + Brewery)
* combine with rogue lite/like elements
* decide which route to take: curch or catharian
* more options than in Bitlife: you should be able to do stuff
* may not be too enjoyable, but can easily be implemented in one month
* more real decisions + more transparancy what are the consequences of the player's actions

## (!!) Brewery/Tavern Management
* Brew beer, but you have limited resources
* the beer must have a high enough alcohol value, otherwise there might be bacteria in the beer taht kill people
* day/night resource management system
* day different segments: different actions = decisions like get new resources, brew, improve inn, ...

## Building Castles
* wood and stone resource management and building game
* tower defense: for every kill you get resources/points to upgrade the castle. At one point there are too many enemies, the castle gets burned down. You loose all wood but the stones stay there. Then you have to rebuild everything
* once defeated you become the attacker or we make it more rogue like (you keep some resources for the next round)

## (!!) Latin text Translation
* Inspired from Baba is You
* we have a fixed amount of latin sentences from the bible
* you have to translate sentences to make people do stuff
* like a mini simulation (conways game of life)
* every sunday people go to church and you define new rules
