## Golden Bull
* Wikipedia definition: A golden bull was a decree issued by Byzantine Emperors and monarchs in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
* There are multiple golden bulls, we could use the "Diploma Andreanum"
  * issued by King Andrew II of Hungary in 1224
  * granting provisional autonomy to colonial Germans residing in the region of Transylvania
* we could create a literal golden bull
* instead of being forced to issue the golden bull, Andrew II of Hungary releases a golden bull (animal)
* the bull must be caught by the player, only then the colonial Germans are granted provisional autonomy
* (other golden bulls work as well)
* the game can be a jump&run
