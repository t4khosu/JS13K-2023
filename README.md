## The Cathar
Our initial and unrefined game concepts can be found [here](ideas/README.md).

## Zip Compression
The powershell script [compress.ps1](scripts/compress.ps1) iterates over different zip compression algorithms and settings to guarantee, that we receive the best possible zip.
It is a brute force approach which works fine when the source directory/files are small.

1233, Toulouse, time of the inquisition.
The catholics and their soldiers try their best to slaughter the Cathars.
In their eyes the cathars' belief testifies to heresy. 

You are one of the cathars and sadly just killed by a soldier. However,
without salvation you are forced to be reincarnated. Will you be able to stop the inquisition?
