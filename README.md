# JS13K-2023

Entry for the [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/) 2023 GameJam by [Christian Staudte](https://github.com/t4khosu) and  [Tim Streicher](https://github.com/coronoro).

## Techstack
* npm or yarn?
* framework (e.g. kontra) or no framework?
* TS or JS?

## Zip Compression
The powershell script [compress.ps1](scripts/compress.ps1) iterates over different zip compression algorithms and settings to guarantee, that we receive the best possible zip.
It is a brute force approach which works fine when the source directory/files are small.

## Ideas
