## Zip Compression
The powershell script [compress.ps1](scripts/compress.ps1) iterates over different zip compression algorithms and settings to guarantee, that we receive the best possible zip.
It is a brute force approach which works fine when the source directory/files are small.

In the current inquisition the catholics try their best to kill all Cathars.
In their eyes the cathar's belief is heresy. You were just killed by a catholig, however,
without salvation you are forced to be reincarnated. Will you be able to stop the inquisition?
