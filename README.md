## Zip Compression

The powershell script [compress.ps1](scripts/compress.ps1) iterates over different zip compression algorithms and
settings to guarantee, that we receive the best possible zip.
It is a brute force approach which works fine when the source directory/files are small.

1233, Toulouse.
In the current inquisition the catholics try their best to kill all Cathars.
In their eyes the Cathars belief in two gods is heresy and must be punished.

You are a Cathar!
Tragically killed by a catholic inquisitor.
Without salvation you are trapped in an endless cycle of reincarnation in the material realm of the evil god.
With the guidance of your gods you embark on a quest to stop the inquisition.
Will you be able to stop their Crusade and break the cycle?
